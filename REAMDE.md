# Functional Programming Presentation

Some slides that I had originally put together on google slides for a presentation that the Algoma University COSC club asked me to do. These were kindly turned into a reveal-cljs presentation by @xtvaser.
The slideshow is currently hosted [here](https://func-programming-pres.firebaseapp.com/) if you wish to view it.

### How to run locally

If for some reason you want to run the slideshow locally instead of viewing it where it's currently hosted, you can do so.

First, ensure that you have [Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) installed.

And run the below command.
```bash
clojure -A:fig
```

This will build the slides and by default host them at `http://localhost:9500` for you to view.

### Examples

After the slides we ran through some code examples. You can find those [here](src/examples/).
